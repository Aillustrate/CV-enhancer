# 📄🖊️🤖 CV Enhancement with the use of LLM
> A service where AI can give you some hints on how to improve your resume
## 🧭 See our [demo](https://5d8e813898ddd7eb9d.gradio.live)
A prototype of an assistant for people who are actively searching for job. The service accepts a pair of vacancy and CV and answers how well the CV matches the job description, whether it contains main sections (work experience, education, hard and soft skills), what information can be added and what can be improved. If the CV and the job description do not match at all (e.g. the user do not have basic skills required for that job, or is not experienced enough), the service will honestly tell about that and suggest what the user might need.

## Experiments

<a name="dataset"></a>
### Dataset
For our experiments, we parsed data from a job aggregator platform [hh.ru](https://hh.ru). Code for parsing is avalible [here](https://github.com/abdullinilgiz/LLMmatch).

### Models

We conducted experiments with 2 models: [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) и [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1). We decided to try these models because both of them are open 
source and do not require payment to use. In addition, both of these models perform well in other tasks.

### Metrics
Due to the fact that the result that the LLMs give as back is the plain text, the is no other way to evaluate the performance of the models other than human effort. So we decided to develop your own assessment methodology and give each 
resulting text a score from 0 to 5 according to the following criteria:

- **Adequacy**: The model adequately assesses the suitability of the CV for the job description. If the CV does not suit the vacancy at all, it says so directly.
- **Reliability**: The model does not operate on information that is not in the job description/CV.
- **Usefulness**: The answer is not made up of obvious things. The model gives really valuable advices on the topics that the user can study or how to reformulate the CV for better match with the jobs description.
- **Honesty**: The model does not request the user to lie about their skills. However, it can offer some topics to study.
- **Linguistic correctness**: The answer does not contain spelling, grammatical or punctuation errors.
- **Coherence**: The answer is logically connected.

### Results
We condacted the experiments with both models changing the following generation parameters: do_sample and temperature.
- **do_sample** is a parameter that determines the sampling strategy (selection of the next token) during the generation. If do_sample=True, then generation method will use Sample Decoding and it gives the opportunity to play with the temperature parameter. If do_sample=False, then generation method will use greedy decoding.
- **temperature** is one of the key parameters of generation. The more temperature is, the model will use more "creativity", and the less temperature instruct model to be "less creative", but following your prompt stronger.

**The results of evaluation the performance of the models were as follows:**

| model     |	do_sample | temperature	| adequacy | reliability | usefulness |	honesty |	linguistic correctness | coherence |
| --------- |	--------- | ----------	| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |	------- |	---------------------- | --------- |
|Llama-2-7b |	False     | 1.00      	| **4.75** | 4.25        | **4.50**   |	**5.00**|	**5.00**               | 4.00      |
|Llama-2-7b |	True      | 1.25      	| 2.83     | **4.33**    | 2.50       |	**5.00**|	**5.00**               | 4.83      |
|Mistral-7B |	False     | 1.00      	| 3.67     | **4.33**    | 3.33       |	4.67    |	**5.00**               | 4.00      |
|Mistral-7B |	True      | 1.00      	| 3.50     | 4.00        | 4.00       |	**5.00**|	**5.00**               | **5.00**  |

All of this metrics are averaged across all model answers and all team members who were involved in the assessment. There are only the best metric sets and all of the metrics are available in this [notebook](notebooks/evaluation.ipynb)

In general, we can say that in our case the accuracy and adequacy of the model answers are more important than creativity so the better results were achieved with the lower values of the temperature parameter. If we compare all the metrics of models with all combinations of parameters, we can say that, according to our estimates, **Llama-2-7b model with greedy decoding copes best with the task**.


🌏 Scaling prospects
Currently, there is only an independent server. But there was also a scaling potential for the project. It can be used as a worker in services such as k8s or docker-compose. You will need to write a docker container. Please use a load balancer (e.g. nginx) to distribute incoming connections between workers. In this case, the service scales horizontally almost indefinitely, including to different geolocation servers.

🔥 Performance evaluation
All measurements were performed on the following configuration: Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2698 v3 processor with a frequency of 2.30 GHz. Number of cores available: 8. Available memory: 32 GB. Memory frequency: 2133 GHz. But the execution on the processor is currently very slow because it is not optimized for 32-bit numbers. Please use a GPU, for example, a 3090, as in our laboratory. Then the response generation will take about 20 seconds on average. This is not suitable for use on mobile devices, but it can still be deployed in data centers.

We got the following results: RAM usage: no more than 1 GB (typical consumption is around 200 MB). Performance: 8 frames per second. This result shows good performance - the service, being deployed on a mid-segment mobile device using a built-in GPU, is capable of processing video at 8-16 frames per second.
