As seen on your CV, you have around five to six years of experience in programming, including a significant chunk of experience as a web programmer. Your most recent work experience involves developing websites and apps for a company based out of \u041e\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a, and previously you worked as an automation programmer for a research institution. However, as an AI assistant, I do not observe any mentions of any remote job experiences or gig work.\nSince the job description you've shared requires knowledge of object-oriented programming in C\\*, experience with C\\*, winapi, technologies for access to data, libraries, and SQL, having some kind of freelancing/remoting experience mentioned at your CV as relevant skills or experience would be beneficial.\nIt would be best if you also aimed to include specific details like a duration or the type of remote work you do. Some freelancing or remoting work might be relevant even if you don't observe them as important skills. Including them helps in portraying your flexibility to recruiters, which often helps with landing job interviews. Please focus on these aspects before you apply anywhere else, and make sure to highlight those points in the most specific way possible in your job interviews. Overemphasizing soft skills or general project descriptions doesn't directly add much of a punch to your application while interviewing for roles with remote components without a solid remote-specific experience in your background doesn't play in your favor unless you have a great fit with the companies remoteness and flexibility needs. Focusing in specifics as mentioned should help greatly, I promise. Additionally, a good AI-generated elevator summary would boost up the resume considerably. Your current summary is very concise but you could expand on certain points about the job and duties briefly highlighted like what programming frameworks you've built from scratch or mentioning major milestones or product releases and technologies at different career stages that showcase relevant career advancement that can make recruiters consider applicants beyond purely based on the duration if time spent is less significant to them or they lack experience but could potentially consider those whose growth indicates promising future potential with minimal on-ground time at a job role compared to what's mentioned or not listed yet on the career summary to provide more context. The overall layout is decent, but could improve further to better reflect some of these details.\nIt is imperative to be honest. \n\nAdditionally, when highlighting work samples, please focus on providing specific, tangible examples that illustrate your technical skills and accomplishments and ensure the samples don't include any irrelevant projects not related to the role (in terms of what needs to be delivered based on duties of the job posted). Focus on showcasing at least one project you can expand on deeply with an elevator summary within the CV itself, as well as others. Having a handful would let the job search algorithm pick and give them a better selection as candidates based on better results relevancy rank wise, which helps candidates in securing better interviews. Moreover, if your sample's are based upon technologies or programming fields unrelated or peripheral to most jobs as a C+Programmer or DevOps specialist, then recruiters won't feel motivated to read those parts further or pick your application among the better ranked ones within the applicant pool from jobs you'd most likely fit even without direct technical job-related experience due to the presence of relevant knowledge fields but missing the hands-on project exposure despite that specific expertise with the relevant field (which leads recruiters to consider someone who posses all such fields but doesn't do hands on direct professional work relevant directly like a pro as potentially a very promising \"middle layer candidate\"). For now though do your current samples match up better with other important job-relevant aspects we analyzed like skill set or field areas from job ad descriptions matching your resume entries without mismatches or direct warnings in specific skill or technologies notified for lacking?

I will be paying close attention to your work experience, education, hard and soft skills, and how well they match the job description provided.\nBased on the job description provided, it seems like the job of a regional manager in sales (\u041e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u043b\u044c) needs someone with experience in active sales and cold calling, ability to lead business meetings, ability to build long-term relationships with clients, etc. Let's go through each section of your CV to assess how well it fits the job:\nWork experience: Your current job description states that you have worked for 5 years and 7 months as a regional manager in sales. This is good. Does your job let you have time to apply to this job or can they arrange flexible working hours? 24 months in this post and no promotions? This could raise concerns about advancement possibilities. Maybe that\u2019s an area to develop as you move forward? But this is adequate for this job? Please give any specific job you are holding right now. Are there any other work experience- related things you would like assistance with?\nEducation: Although I commend your efforts in your high school program in the Russian State Social University, in my profession, work experience often plays a much more critical role in getting the job than college experience does. Perhaps a certificate that would help your abilities would make sense. What was your job immediately before your recent job and could you return to that firm again someday? Can you improve this area? \nHard and soft skills: From your cv, the work experience section clearly lists cold selling sales, hot and cold selling, direct sales with legal bodies. This is good! However, you lack knowledge in customer service, etc; perhaps focusing on learning and perfecting this set of skills will go a long way. Consider incorporating skills like cold selling, cold and hot call taking, b- to \u2013b sales, sales consulting, workshops related to sales to perfect them. Remember, though, if the field shifts, update the knowledge. Can you provide more details about any relevant workshops? Add training on business and legal knowledge, for instance? How are you going to use your unique qualities and talents to your advantage here? Consider your talents; how does that support you here to build skills? Could that potentially work with clients even as a newcomer in a unique manner? What soft skills are you trying to target here? What changes, if any, would be needed to tailor these points more broadly to this sales post?\nPeculiarities: Apart from your personal information and your current contact information is the field where additional details about your last employer (Marimex Company in sales and marketing) will be necessary for filling in. If the hiring company requires you to use cold selling skills to make decisions based on the information you share or if they want some insight into the current and expected progress, include more detail here regarding the product. Would you mind incorporating details for this? Do you know what type of additional technical details your prospective employer seeks? Do let me know what would work best in each instance. As a salesperson in a remote region, there would still need to be some personal interaction for you and your current employer, which could then improve the quality of our goods as far as that sales effort is concerned. In certain circumstances, it may serve the goal. Additionally, it would help us focus on what you bring to our company in a region (perhaps with the assistance of a telecom partner) for effective sales delivery. If we are already doing this via some online strategy via the corporation's intranet, a more successful work process may be carried out with some face-to-face selling in meetings, along with the delivery of good feedback about performance and how to enhance future selling efforts across various channels. The fact that the business currently doesn't have any partners makes selling online even tougher for someone, in which case one is required to have more resources dedicated purely to creating partnerships. This has always seemed a straightforward aspect that most salespeople, for instance, have struggled with throughout time. Therefore I am bringing it up once more regarding the unique challenges 2\u0413\u0438\u0434 might have selling online or over the phones compared to an in-office arrangement with multiple clients. Again here, if 2 \u0413\u0438\u0434 has already thought a little about this and decided these unique features won't be as necessary for selling its goods, so tell them I do not need these added.\nIn summary, highlighting in cold and warm selling skills with details about your current and most recent", "adequacy": 2, "reliability": 3, "usefulness": 4, "honesty": 3, "linguistic correctness": 3, "coherence": 2}, "yb22w0": {"cv": "data/CVs/asu_tp.txt", "job": "data/Vacancies/asu_tp/2.txt", "system_prompt": "Imagine you are a helpful career assistant.

You have included a clear summary of your professional and educational background, your most significant experiences, and your skills. You have also included your relevant qualifications and your career objectives. However, I believe there are a few areas that could use improvement, especially in relation to the job you have applied for.\n\nFirstly, I would like to mention that I have taken note of the location of the job, Beliaevo, Moscow, and that you are willing to relocate or not. This is an important aspect to consider and will vary depending on the person and their individual circumstances.\n\nJob Description Review:\n\nThe job description clearly outlines what is expected of the ideal candidate, including the required qualifications and experience. You would need prior experience and knowledge in System administration in a computer network environment, as well as experience in implementing and maintaining software solutions.\n\nIn addition, experience in system security and network administration would be advantageous. You should have an understanding of network protocols and technologies, including firewalls, routers, and DNS servers. Experience in server administration and database management would be a plus as well.\n\nIf you do not possess these qualifications, it would be best to look into acquiring the necessary knowledge and training before applying for this job. You can start by taking online courses or taking courses in person at a local community college or university.\n\nImprovement suggestions:\n\nTo improve your CV, I would suggest the following:\n\n* Highlight your relevant experiences and how they align with the job requirements. Be specific and provide examples of what you have accomplished in your previous roles.\n* Focus on your technical skills and how they relate to the job. Make sure to provide specific examples of the technologies you have worked with and your experience in using them.\n* Consider listing any certifications or training you have completed in relevant areas. This will demonstrate your commitment to professional development and will make your application more competitive.\n* Finally, make sure to proofread your CV carefully. Typos and grammatical errors can make a negative impression on a recruiter or hiring manager.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.

Work experience: Although you have mentioned your experience in detail, you could provide more information on how you applied your skills and experience to solve real-world problems. For example, you could mention specific projects or initiatives that you led, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

Education: Although you have mentioned your degree and institution, you could provide more details on your coursework and grades. This will help the employer understand your expertise in the field.\n3. Hard and soft skills: You have mentioned some of your hard skills such as Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, and React. However, you could provide more details on your soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. The employer wants to know how you will fit in with their team and how you will contribute to the project.\n4. Address: Although you have mentioned your address, it is not clear if you are willing to relocate for the job. It is important to be clear about your location and willingness to relocate in your CV.\n\nBased on the job description, it seems that the employer is looking for a candidate with at least 3-6 years of experience in system analysis.

Let's keep this discussion focused solely on technical skills. It is important to keep the review brief and not get overwhelmed. The more detailed, the better we have a better chance at understanding it. It provides insights into what skills are necessary, which are missing, and how you can acquire them.\n====================================================================\n\nCV Match for the Job: Based on the CV, the matching of CV and job description seems to vary. Currently, the skills required for the job seem not to match those listed in the CV. If this job is your dream job, you should think of learning programming languages that are on the current job you\u2019ve listed, as stated many times \"\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\". Therefore, there are some requirements that must be met before applying for this job. If a job description doesn't require these skills mentioned in the Job Description, I would recommend reading as much as is related to these programming skills that you'll be required, that are popular in the job industry and start applying job that suit these requirements and then slowly build upon that, but do aim to meet the requirements needed for this job you have listed first as it does seem to suit you best for it.\nThe CV you posted currently don't mention many experience-based programming-related job experience, which is why the job you listed does not appear to require a lot of technical skills. If your CV reflects these required abilities, you do stand a chance at job offers that requires your specific technical knowledge. And we believe it has many skills you can still enhance later using online-certification-program. Therefore, it\u2019s best advise you can make the most out of your CVs by making it stand specifically out from others who have lesser experience compared to you, by adding job responsibilities that fit those skills.\n\nEducation: You have completed an Institution in Information technologies in IAchtek. However, the course and duration are not relevant for your job, so any skills I learn should match job requirements . Therefore you may need training. But on the positive side, this means an open book as it can always be refinined and updated by using specific techniques, algorithms and modern programming practices and methods.

Your overall professional experience is mostly concentrated in telecomm infrastructure maintenance instead of LKS (civil industrial) maintenance and upgrade work as needed. There are no indications in the work area of any relevant qualifications like telecom cables training from professional organizations or certification programs relevant. It would help if you added additional qualifications under the instruction column, especially considering the job requirements mentioned earlier (driver, A category validator.)\nYou appear not to meet other crucial parts of these job descrip requirements since none of your previous three positions specified a place such as an apartment and had a specific work time (i.e.., for 14 years and four months with RoseTelem, starting month for four years. Six months with TechnoMech Service) It would help if you had your addresses in mind during employment, which will significantly assist our location needs for jobs we help people apply for at our locations if they're local or remote possibilities for remote employment since these places would help us learn their technical skills levels in various regions worldwide without incentives from prospective employees when their profiles show no skills pertinet to any workplace location on planet earth.\nFinally, you must possess all required licensing (A category vehicle driver's license) when needed (work area indicated Moscow).

Your chances then would  significantly improve because it helps you present them not just the basic requirements on the certification/licenses form provided while completing the online driver education or CDL class A/commercal B program; for all practical exercises leading u p tot olicensse/license, but even beyond since driving courses will help identify more potential job-related risks faced by this driver' position type so those crucial elements in your profile will appear better tailores ed accordingly via course or program curr IC knowledge (as described further down.)  \nBy doing so, the improvement opportunities I identified earlier could include completing more work experience with diverse industries, enrolling your employment details (if there aren't  many), certifying more transferable skills through hobbies or volunteer gigs, adding extra course specialization areas under professional programs' continuing education list as possible and mentioning such add-on qualifications within that area of your profile, showing certifications gained during those areas where specific expertise qualifies under other industry specializations via cross-checkmark selections when applying for jobs under specializations unlisted elsewhere as an entry, listing extra language  proficiency through volunteering projects (local groups practicioneng local Diailogs or  local business workshop classes) plus relevant language courses you might find via scholarship opportunities available at nearby colleges offering community language course, volunteership with local non-goverment groups requiring translator assistance to fulFill community contract duties.   \nGuideline-  Aim of writing these recommendations is maximizing improvement chanc.

While this appears to match your abilities, this process necessitates further honing since the work may incorporate numerous other duties and challenges. I propose focusing on highlighting your expertise in this field. For example, in addition to basic technologies, what distinguishing skills could you mention and how could those talents best be used and emphasized while keeping in mind potential technologies used now or later; what about agile development knowledge and your involvement in successful team projects?\n\nSecondly, pay close attention to keeping up-to-date with the rapidly shifting technological landscape and the development of relevant expertise. Because technologies like AI and Cloud computing continue to evolve quickly, keeping up-to-date with market developments ensures a thorough understanding of these new trends and their possible uses. As part of your professional activities, highlight how you keep current with emerging ideas.\n\nOverall, the job notice indicates that it may be beneficial to gain knowledge of other areas or projects.

Attending relevant conferences, participation in trade events and trade exhibitions, taking courses at vocational schools and learning from successful people in related firms to develop a professional network by forging useful relationships and creating personal rapport are strategies to broaden your perspective.

Here are some key points to focus on:\n\n1. Work experience: You have 16 years of experience, which is great! However, I noticed that most of your experience comes from 2 companies - MAO\u0423 \"Shool No.1\" and TS \"Vesta-Inform\". You might consider adding some projects or gigs you worked on in the meantime to showcase your skills and experience.\n2. Education: I see that you have some completed higher education from 2000, which is great. However, considering this job posting specifically looks for individuals without experience in SYSTEMD, adding some certifications or diplomas related to this field could help make your resume more appealing to recruiters.\n3. Hard and soft skis: There is no doubt that you have valuable hard skills, including POS setup and computer hardware maintenance. However, having relevant hard skills would mean more to recruiters. Soft skills like \"teamworking\" would be helpful, while your \"\u041erganizzaetronline\" certificate would still show to employers, so make sure it is polished and up-to-date. Adding keywords related to soft and hard skills that are commonly used on job openings could strengthen your applicants' visibility.\n\nOn top of what should probably include more emphasis on, I spotted that there are also sections you do not necessarily need for now. Likewise, the job ad is asking that there be no need in \"committing a vehicle, housing conditions.\" The important parts for your information are what happens when those details would be of importance when needed. The jobs of remote works as well make that point important at least worthwhile to list where in that category you are based at your convenience so as to not require transport for this one and other reasons. So make the best choice if you cannot. Consider your skills and fit when highlighting work for your main point at first so all your skills in different areas of interest in and other projects of life (which sounds like what this current one may ask in future, which it should so I did note). So let that work as what makes your best point. However, as in that sense if it is remote work you need not put away that location detail as they should and do care little for it. Keep the format organized well when adding or removing from CV based on its suggestions to ensure it provides more value to your resum\u00e9s rather than clunkiness due to inconsistencies in sectioning. Consider changing dates into month/year formats only (month followed by the year and dates followed). Use bullet points if listing items or separating ideas in smaller chunks and make that important keywords more of your format, so these CV reviews can focus better. Highlight the areas of best relevance regarding the type of job by color, underline them where this makes sense most to bring eye focus and clarity, consider keeping relevant but superfluous details like hobby and skill information for after making other points standout while ensuring formatting and emphasis in such cases do work as they could take most valuable space.

Additionally, providing contact information or a detailed address can improve  your visibility to potential employers. Including such details such as soft and hard skills in your CV can show a prospective employer  how you are uniquely qualified for the position.\nI suggest  you include more information about your communication and persuasion skills in your CV  because  you mentioned you have experience in this area in the job description.

Your CV highlights your proficiency with tools like cold calls, business meetings, and contract negotiations, all of which are relevant to the job.

According to the job posting, the employer is looking for a candidate with experience in \u043c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e-\u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e and \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0435\u0439, but your work experience is only related to \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430. Therefore, you may need to gain more experience in this area or gain relevant courses to fill in the gap.\n\nSecondly, let's talk about education. Your education background is relevant for the job as you studied atCheboxrsy technikuem of communication network, but it would be better if you had some courses in \u0435 electrical engineering and/or electronics, as the job requires knowledge of electrical circuits and electronics, which may be a good foundation for your job as a cable technician.\n\nThirdly, let's take a look at the hard and soft skills section. You have mentioned some skills, such as\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0436 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f and \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, but they are not detailed enough. The employer wants to see more technical details about your skills, such as specific software, hardware, or tools you have experience in working with. Additionally, you may want to add more soft skills like teamwork, time management, communication, and problem-solving to make yourself a more competitive candidate.\n\nLastly, let's analyze your work experience. Your work experience in \u041c\u0413\u0422\u0421 shows that you have experience in managing and coordinating with teams and projects, however, this section is not well-written and lacks details. It would be better if you could highlight more of the responsibilities and achievements you have gained in your previous role, as this will give the employer an insight into your problem-solving skills and potential.\n\nBased on your feedback, here are my recommendations:\n* Update your education section to include relevant courses in electrical engineering and/or electronics.\n* Add more technical details about your skills, such as specific software, hardware, or tools you have experience in working with.\n* Expand your work experience section to include more responsibilities and achievements from your previous roles.\n* Consider taking relevant courses to gain more experience in the field of\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0443\u044e-\u0436\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e and \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0435\u0439,\n* Showcase your ability to work in a team and communicate effectively. \n\nOverall, with these improvements, I believe you have a good chance of landing the job you want!\n\nCare to get any advice on how to improve your resume further?", "adequacy": 3, "reliability": 3, "usefulness": 5, "honesty": 5, "linguistic correctness": 2, "coherence": 5}, "837871": {"cv": "data/CVs/electro.txt", "job": "data/Vacancies/electro/2.txt", "system_prompt": "Imagine you are a helpful career assistant.

You have worked for several different companies over the years, and some of your job titles are not very specific. For example, you mention working as a \"\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043a-\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0449\u0438\u043a\" for MGTS, but you don't provide any details about the specific projects you worked on or the skills you used.

However, you only have 16 years of experience, which is less than the required experience for the job. You should mention in your CV that you are eager to gain new experience and are willing to learn from more experienced professionals.

It is vital to match the  you listed to their desired job skills and responsibilities because many job opportunities focus mostly on technician tasks involving some computer tasks and general knowledge but some roles focus less on general duties and more on detailed electonic circuit analysis  installation testing procedures for AS-BOS (automated control systems or buildings) but also focus mostlyon other electircal works to ensure optimal building condition that the occupants or user may have their desired comfortable zone while providing un- interrupted services that minimizes building maintenance for long usage. From a closer look, my observation point towards modification and additional information which may include but not limited t : you do not detail work specific locations like Moscow city; which are more likely available so that you  can clearly illustrate where each job took place and how long with accurate date and even add dates to reflect when new tools became part of how things are handled and how it helped minimized issues on how such location may need  modification or changes to enhace safety or optimize usage\nHowever the location should not contain dates rather provide it under ' extra experience in extra sections\n\nPlease describe one situation like that where these modification came in handl  in that experience provided to give insight of problem solvi nig strategy  3 Work experience: please  list out technical electrical circuit analys is,   electrical projects handled for particular buildings types to increase efficiency. give examples which shows technicalities which will relate to this AS automation task you wish to pursue,\nIt does include, but isn't limitded ti list experience regarding installation, programming, and some  mechanical work experience relevant to  task . Please include details on which type on  control tools you may consider relevant here: GE Fanuc,  Siemens. This would indicate  knowledge towards technica expertise relevant task at  AS job setting\nAnother section is, educational knowledge and the like should you mention some courses on data structures that aligns you task requirements . List relevant ones or the skills, mention the year for 4 year degrees programs , and which courses provided skills and expertise relevant on how they were useful when dealing a system  with different components. For technological knowledge that is likely cruical,  mention technical topics learned to identify how important technical courses were  cruical knowledge which you attained and the time. Please go though extra sections to see modifications for technical improvement\nI notice  a glancing skip and vague descriptions  on when relevant experience in extra secciones which I encourage adding some basic experience details . You should avoid vague answers so as a recruiter understand specific details when recritivities search for  a candidate  They can quickly  dismiss candidates that have such issues, so they get easily overseen so you need a way  of enouragining modification before a long period before application is complete to allow you make cruitcal adjusts to your particular detail to suit your preference  \nThis job description mostly has task-based operations of different nature with basic electrical operations which requires expert understanding of system issues and requirements but  no much need f general operation and supervised functions that some other engineering works have to address . From my perspective  there ae some key issues that  are  relevant enough  to consider if it is AS technical task . please elaborate 4 Hard skilled:  here address  a few critical points. Some tasks required skills related work with specific hardware components like automobile batteries used for contstruction or automotive and electrical appreniceships, yet not technical  knowledge   required  for your interest in this technical  field in most ways possible, these jobs could provide technical knowleduge relating to your main interest.  You have electirc safety issues that affect the outcome of an assessmnet but some people don;t know when such occurs and thus your specific experience and background information could help solve   the issues so the knowledge you hold is relevant,\nThere may even be the occasion they the recruiter or someone of interest you send assessemnt information is relevant technical information and experience provided in this case as a CV  add on  and some recruiters will  want this for themselves as assessment  on experience that has relation to the main tasks in consideration will provide added value so please ensure your hard skill  has that specific focus to", "adequacy": 2, "reliability": 2, "usefulness": 2, "honesty": 3, "linguistic correctness": 2, "coherence": 3}}
